# FivePD API

### Get started

Before you start making your callouts, it's recommended to take a look at [how to write your first script in FiveM](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/scripting-manual/runtimes/csharp/) as this API is basically nothing more, but a wrapper to make it easier to write callouts with the reduced chance of doing something error prone (With extended features).

##### Creating a new callout using the example
1. Download the CalloutExample project.
2. Open the project and start making your new callout.

##### From scratch
1. Create a new C# Class Library project and make sure the target framework version is 4.5.2.
2. Add CalloutAPI.dll as a reference.
3. Add CitizenFX.Core.dll as a reference.
